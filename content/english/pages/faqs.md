## Absent Presenters

If a presenter is unable to be there and . . . 

-   the moderator is familiar with the topic, they may field the questions themselves

-   there are colleagues of the presenter there, they may answer on the presenter's behalf

-   neither of those are the case, the session may dismiss earlier and attendees either have informal discussions amongst themselves or move on to the next thing/enjoy a short break

## When can I see recorded presentations?

If a speaker has submitted a pre-recorded presentation, it will be available in the app.

Recorded sessions will be uploaded to the proceedings by the end of 2025. Most sessions will be recorded.
