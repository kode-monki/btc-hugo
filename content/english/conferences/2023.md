“Quality” is an important aspect of Bible translations produced at home and abroad. The end users of a Bible translation usually have certain expectations regarding the quality, style, and presentation of the translation that is being produced. In meaning-based Bible translation, the main qualities of good translations are often described in terms of Accuracy, Clarity, Naturalness, and Acceptability (or: Appropriateness). But these are not the only qualities that Bible translators take into consideration. Some other qualities that may (or may not) be taken into account are the following: Concordance / consistency, poetic diction, fluency / readability, oral communication style, compatibility in form and meaning with the most prestigious Bible translation in the national language, etc.
