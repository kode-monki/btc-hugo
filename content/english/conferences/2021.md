The theme ‘Paradigms of Bible translation’ intends to deepen our understanding of translation principles and practices that are followed by translation practitioners from different backgrounds. It aims to build mutual understanding and a higher degree of consensus regarding best practices in Bible translation. The presentations are expected to foster constructive dialogue and avoid judgmental criticism of other positions.
