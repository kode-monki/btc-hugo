The pursuit of Scripture for all ‘in this generation’ puts pressure to achieve optimum speed and efficiency. What aspects of the process can be eliminated, done another way, shortened or enhanced? The authors draw on experience and research to identify the assumptions about languages and culture that are made by proponents of artificial intelligence. The authors will then suggest that immersion, illumination and incarnation define the sanctity between the translators and the Holy Spirit in the drafting of a translation. Bypassing these, by utilizing technologies for the sake of speed and efficiency will eliminate the friction that is necessary for Scripture to have ‘breath’ in the community for which it was created. This paper critiques the use of advanced forms of technology through a framework proposed by Craig Gay. He proposes that only the Christian doctrines of creation, incarnation and resurrection are capable of analyzing the impact of technology on humankind. These fundamental beliefs demonstrate that God gives significant value to embodied existence. Finally, the paper will demonstrate with field research and case studies that the impact of machine drafting will result in a diminished result, impeding the quality of final translation. The authors will test the results from human drafted versus machine drafted translations, and transparently provide those results in this paper. Since the rest of the translation process is built upon improving the draft, the foundational position of the drafting process is where qualitative characteristics such as creativity, inculturation and expressiveness should be instilled and safeguarded.
