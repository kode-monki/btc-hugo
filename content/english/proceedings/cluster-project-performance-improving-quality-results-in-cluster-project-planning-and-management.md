Over seventeen years of engagement in cluster projects, trends show that almost sixty percent of cluster projects underperform the written quality translation goals they set for themselves. As cluster projects are engaged globally to accelerate scripture translation and end Bible poverty, addressing common issues in cluster project planning and management is imperative to ensure the future success of this strategy. Cluster project planners and managers can heed the warnings of past cluster projects that vastly underperform their goals, and benefit from identifying key risks in their own management context. By examining elements that contribute to poor project planning and internal management issues, teams can mitigate constraints on project personnel by enacting strategic interventions to their cluster project engagements. This timely examination of cluster project performance can inform planners and managers in partnering Bible agencies on how to refine their engagement in cluster strategies to improve quality results in their cluster projects both now and into the future.
