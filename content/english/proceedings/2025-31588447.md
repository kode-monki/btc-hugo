<p>This paper examines key principles of co-creativity drawn from research on the Shekgalagari Bible Translation Project in Botswana (Rudowske, 2022). The study revealed that successful cross-cultural partnerships require more than good intentions—they demand intentional structures that enable genuine local ownership while incorporating valuable outside expertise. Four essential principles emerged from the research: (1) authentic local agency requires real decision-making power, not just consultation; (2) character and relationships matter more than structures and documents; (3) effective co-creativity balances local ownership with outside expertise; and (4) co-creative processes must be context-specific rather than formulaic. These principles have application beyond Bible translation to any cross-cultural partnership seeking to navigate power dynamics and create sustainable, locally-owned initiatives.</p>
