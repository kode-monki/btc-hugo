<p>Bible agencies consistently overlook the degree of change that is proposed by the introduction of a new Bible translation into a minority or majority language. Bible translation involves significant ecclesiological change and theological changes regarding the nature of Scripture and ritual practice. Recent research demonstrates that Bible agencies assume a greater theological commonality between Bible agencies and host communities than actually tends to exist. This mismatch of theological expectations on the nature and purpose of Bible translation frequently leads to mutual frustration and underused translations.  <br>  <br> The training of Bible translation teams, traditional or church led, should include intentional dialogue between host communities and Bible agencies about the theological starting points of all parties. The goal of such dialogue goes beyond transparency; it also seeks to empower local communities to make informed decisions about their hopes for and practices of Bible translation. Bible translation processes are made more ethical when local stakeholders are empowered to understand the primary motivations of Bible agencies and funding agencies and are thus enabled to choose whether or not to partner with such an effort. Bible translation efforts more generally become more ethical in relation to funders when transparent dialogue between community leaders and agencies creates sufficiently common vision to ensure reasonable satisfaction of all partners. <br> </p>
