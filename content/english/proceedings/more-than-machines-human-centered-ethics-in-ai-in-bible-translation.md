<p>Jesus’s “two greatest commandments” are both relational and require action. Ethics for the use of AI in Bible translation should be relational and active as well. Rather than focusing on what the machine can do, or how human-like it is or isn’t, we advocate for putting human beings and their relationships at the center of decision-making regarding the use of AI. AI is often applied in a technocratic paradigm that both mystifies AI and dehumanizes those affected. Bible translation is a communal, relational, and sacred process that demands better. AI can be a blessing to translation work; translation teams and the communities they serve can have earlier access to a translation enhanced by thorough review. This empowerment also comes with temptations that may damage critical relationships in Bible translation.  <br>  <br> This paper will outline these relationships and the dangers that AI brings. First among these relationships is that between the receiving community and the translation team with God, their creator. Discipleship and internalization of Scripture are important areas where the Bible translation process brings participants closer to God. Secondly, Bible translation depends on healthy team relationship dynamics. This can be especially challenging with the multicultural milieu typically involved in a Bible translation effort: translators; funders; consultants; local churches; local communities and tribes; technology developers; and (new) technology users. In all of these relationships, we will look at five key areas where AI can be a temptation or an opportunity. Unexamined, AI in these relationships can bring: idolatry; legalism; laziness; distraction; and discord. However, when we consider the context of our relationship with God and our neighbors when we use AI, it provides opportunities for enhanced: leadership/creativity; learning; insight; vocation; and engagement.</p>
