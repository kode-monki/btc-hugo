<p>Traditionally, Bible translators and translator support experts have functioned primarily as linguistic, exegetical and theological experts, focusing on the accuracy and faithfulness of translations. However, as the field of Bible translation evolves, there is a growing need for translator support experts to take on a coaching and mentoring role which empowers local teams, engages communities, and facilitates sustainable translation efforts. This shift presents challenges in training, methodology, and the balance between expertise and mentorship. This study explores how Bible Exegetes, Consultants in Training and consultants can transition from experts to mentors  through identification of the skills, strategies, and frameworks necessary to equip and support local translation teams effectively.  <br>  <br> A Qualitative research approach will be used to explore experiences, perceptions, and challenges in the transition from expert to mentor. The Personal and Personnel Development (PPD) in The Word For The World (TWFTW) was established to develop exegetes, consultants, and other personnel into coaches and mentors, supporting Bible translation through various expert roles. The TWFTW case study examines how translator support experts transition into coaching and mentoring roles in translation projects. It identifies challenges and benefits of this shift, develops best practices for mentoring Bible translators, and offers training recommendations. Surveys will gather insights on mentorship's role in skill transfer. Coaching and mentoring contribute to experience, insights, and career growth (Sapienza Journal 2025). Observations of interactions between translator support experts and local translators in workshops such as Oral Bible Translation (OBT) projects Diploma in BT or translation sessions will be held.. Petruzzi (2025) states that mentoring is a way of supporting employees in the process of achieving career success, so it is important to understand its impact on translator support experts. <br>  <br> Key terms:, translator support expert, mentoring, coaching,  transition</p>
