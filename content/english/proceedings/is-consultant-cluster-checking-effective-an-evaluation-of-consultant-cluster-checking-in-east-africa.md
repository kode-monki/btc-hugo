Cluster checking is the most frequently used form of consultant checking in one area of East Africa.  This kind of checking is primarily exegetical checking.  In this paper, the negative and positive aspects of cluster checking will be shared with a special focus on the checking of three translations of Exodus  in October 2022.  In preparation for this cluster checking session, a large number of notes were prepared for each team. The impact of these notes on the translations will be discussed. In addition, observations will be shared about various improvements in Paratext that have made cluster checking more feasible. Despite the fact that cluster checking may not be the best form of consultant checking, the interaction between the teams in such a checking session often leads to improvements in the translations that probably would not have happened in a comprehension style checking session with one team.
