<p>Pollution … Biodiversity loss … Climate change. Environmental crises are already affecting those in translation ministry, the communities we seek to serve, and those who support our work. According to a recent Lancet study, 84% of young people globally report being worried about the environment. Many use words like “grief” and “despair” to describe their feelings. </p>
<br>
<p>How much should concern for global environmental crises impact our ministry as translators and consultants? Not at all? Or should we all immediately stop flying, driving and using plastics? How can we ensure we are acting ethically in our lives and in our translation work? How can our behaviour be shaped by Jesus’ ministry?</p>
<br>
<p>This paper explores both the responsibilities we face as translation workers to care for God’s earth and the opportunities for gospel engagement which arise due to increasing awareness of global ecological crisis. </p>
<br>
<p>Three possible grounds for a Christian ecological ethic are outlined: stewardship, eco-justice, and witness. </p>
<br>
<p>Selected verses from Jonah are analysed to discover how accurately the non-human creation has been included in translations into various languages. </p>
<br>
<p>Since 2020 SIL has officially been encouraging staff to minimise the ecological harm resulting from their activities. Practical strategies for translators and consultants to do this are proposed.</p>
<br>
<p>Concern about ecological crisis also provides an opportunity to powerfully witness to gospel truths about God’s plan for new creation. Some inspiring examples of this are given. </p>
