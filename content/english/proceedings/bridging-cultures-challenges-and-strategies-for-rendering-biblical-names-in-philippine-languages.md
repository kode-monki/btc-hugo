<p>The transliteration of biblical names has been historically complex, shaped by multiple linguistic layers and the interplay of religious and cultural traditions. As Jože Krašovec (2004) notes, ancient translations such as the Septuagint (LXX) and the Latin Vulgate lacked standardization, leading to inconsistencies that persist across modern translations. These inconsistencies arise from phonological adaptations, intermediary transmission, and the influence of dominant literary traditions. In the case of Philippine Bible translations, biblical names have been adapted primarily from Spanish and English sources rather than directly from Hebrew or Greek. This reliance on intermediary traditions has resulted in variations in spelling and pronunciation, affecting both readability and acceptability for Filipino readers. <br>  <br> This study examines how biblical names are transliterated in Tagalog, Cebuano, Ibaloi, and Tawbuid, focusing on the influence of Spanish and English on name adaptation. Using a stratified random sample of 450 names from a dataset of 3,250 names, the research analyzes phonemic and orthographic modifications. Additionally, it examines the role of national and regional languages in shaping transliteration choices and considers the broader implications of these patterns for standardization and readability in Philippine Bible translations. <br> By situating the discussion within the larger history of biblical name transmission, this study contributes to ongoing conversations on linguistic consistency, cultural familiarity, and transliteration strategies in multilingual Bible translation. The findings aim to support Bible translators by developing transliteration guidelines for standardized name rendering, which can be incorporated into Translation Briefs and Style Guides to ensure greater consistency in future translation projects. Through this, the study provides practical insights for translators and linguists working in multilingual Bible translation contexts. <br>  <br> </p>
