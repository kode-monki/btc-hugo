It is now more acceptable for Bible translation projects to start and/or continue with diaspora communities outside of the homeland area. But it is just as important to assess the migration history and flow of communities with ongoing projects, so dispersed members of the language community can be included as contributors or end users of all Bible translation work, including materials and Scripture engagement. 

Engaging diaspora communities in these Bible translation projects can require some time and effort, and can even be seen as adding more work to a project. However, the benefits of doing so are significant and should be thoroughly understood before dismissing. This paper argues that diaspora communities hold valuable resources, educated speakers, and added social connections, viewing partnership as crucial to achieving the highest quality results. Drawing on examples from past and current projects, this paper highlights specific ways in which diaspora communities contribute to these efforts. By strategically seeking out and engaging with the diaspora members of a language community, Bible translation projects that plan beyond the local setting when necessary can succeed better in a world where migration is a reality.
