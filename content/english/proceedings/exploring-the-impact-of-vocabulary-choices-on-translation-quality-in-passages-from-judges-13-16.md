This paper considers the impact of vocabulary choice on the quality of translation. Through exegesis and reception history of passages in Judges 13-16 the paper demonstrates the impact of ‘loaded language’ on translation and subsequent interpretation. ‘Loaded language’ refers to vocabulary with conceptual and cultural meaning beyond a simple definition. For example the verb ‘to nag’, is loaded with implied meaning in English speaking cultures; it is more likely to be used of women than of men, and it carries suggestions of damaging female stereotypes. When Bible translators choose these loaded terms for their translations they are, whether intentionally or not, guiding the reader towards a particular understanding of the text. In texts such as Judges 13-16 these word choices have a significant impact on interpretation. In many English translations of Judges 14, Samson’s wife is said to ‘nag’ Samson. This word choice leads to commentaries and sermons which accuse the wife of being unfaithful or fickle; the use of ‘nag’ pulls the reader’s attention away from what is clear in the text - that she is a desperate woman under threat of death, someone to whom we should show pity not contempt. Whilst this may seem to be a niche issue, hidden away in a small section of Judges, the impact of such word choices is cumulative, story by story they change the overall Biblical narrative with regards to women. This paper asks translators to carefully consider the cultural schemata associated with their word choices.
