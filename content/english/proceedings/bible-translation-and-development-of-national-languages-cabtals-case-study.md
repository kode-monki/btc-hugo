The question of identity is becoming one key factor as far as Bible translation is concerned. When the Bible is translated in a language, the speakers of the language just as their descendants identify not just with the language of the Bible but also with the Bible of the language. In order words, translating the Bible is not just about reaching those who can speak and hear the language but it is also about reaching a group of people identifying themselves with the language whether they speak it or not. Bible translation is therefore important in that it helps develop national languages. At the backdrop of this presentation is the idea that Bible translation builds and consolidates the sense of identity. We want in our work to answer the question to know how does this happen concretely? To answer this question we use the experience of CABTAL in Cameroon/Africa. We think that our discoveries can apply in other places in the world. This presentation is taken from an article of the French Journal “Le Sycomore 16.1” published in 2022. After looking at translation as done within the context of CABTAL, we delve into direct and indirect contributions of Bible translation to the development of national languages. Our general conclusion is that the contribution of Bible translation to the development of national languages is multifaceted and operates at different levels and layers. This presentation does not simply make us aware of the role that Bible translation plays in terms of national language development is concerned but also helps us engage with community to see the importance of investing in Bible translation and language development.
