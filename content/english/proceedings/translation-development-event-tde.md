<p>Continual training and professional development for translation advisors, exegetical advisors, and translation consultants is an often overlooked need.  These translation personnel are the most influential in a translation project, yet apart from their initial training they are the most neglected. <br>  <br> TDE (Translation Development Event) is a training event that seeks to bring ongoing training and professional development to this segment of our organization. <br>  <br> TDE is run locally at the Area level, looking at the specific needs of the translation personnel in that region.  One of the key elements in the structure of TDE is that all aspects of the training are focused on translation; that is, training tracks are chosen with translation personnel in mind and they are taught by translation personnel themselves.  The focus is on practical training that translation personnel use in their everyday work. <br>  <br> In this paper we will look at the two TDE events that have happened; TDE Eurasia in 2023 and TDE Asia in 2024.  Each aspect of TDE will be discussed, as well as why these events have had so much success. <br> </p>
