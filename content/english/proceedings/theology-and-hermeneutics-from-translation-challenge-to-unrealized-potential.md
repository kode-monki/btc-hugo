This paper proposes that the contribution of hermeneutics and theology to Bible translation quality lies neither in “neutralizing” its effects nor in determining the “best” lens for exegeting Scripture, but rather in empowering translators as self-reflective participants in the missio dei, whose work facilitates local theologizing within their communities.

Part I of this paper traces the evolution of perspectives on the challenges posed by hermeneutics and theology to Bible translation quality, concluding with the growing consensus that all translation is ideologically influenced. Part II suggests the Bible translation movement should openly acknowledge that advancing the mission of God is one of the primary ideological motivations for our work. It then explores three areas in which embracing a missional ideology can guide the production of higher quality Bible translations. Part III draws on Maria Tymoczko’s (2007) scholarship identifying translators as powerful agents of inter-cultural change to further suggest that the “challenge” of hermeneutics and theology in Bible translation is actually the site of immense potential for greater missiological impact and the strengthening of the local church.
