<p>Ethics in planning Scripture Engagement extends beyond cultural considerations or budgets and timely reporting; it involves accountability to God regarding how we utilize the tools and opportunities available to us, in partnership with a community of believers in a particular context. This communal accountability transcends organizational or denominational distinctions, focusing on the unifying mission to draw people to God through collective efforts that glorify Him. While such a vision may seem idealistic, the failure to take this calling seriously can have serious negative consequences. Without ethical stewardship, we risk focusing more on managing funds and technologies than on nurturing the relationships, opportunities, and resources God has given. Rather than collaborating with partners, we may construct isolated initiatives without understanding the broader context or seeking to complete the work together. Instead of learning from others, we might rely solely on our existing knowledge. We may prioritize quantitative indicators of success over the transformative relationships that reflect genuine change. <br> <br> To address these tendencies, it is essential to cultivate the practice of asking thoughtful, reflective questions. This presentation explores six key questions that can guide managers in assessing and planning Scripture Engagement activities in an ethically responsible manner. These questions focus on critical factors that promote successful engagement and collaboration with the communities we serve. Rather than relying on assumptions or the pressures of pre-established programs and funding requirements, decision-makers will be encouraged to adopt a conversational leadership approach to planning. By engaging in meaningful dialogue and listening carefully, they will be better equipped to steward both human and financial resources effectively. This process of ethical stewardship is supported by a visualized participatory planning tool called &quot;Eyes for Impact,&quot; a name derived from the fact that all six questions begin with the letter ‘I&#x27;, resulting in a visual action plan that helps guide decision-making.</p>
