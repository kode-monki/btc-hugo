This paper will attempt to identify who owns or is responsible for quality in translation and the limitations and levels of that ownership and responsibility. This paper will also discuss what “ownership” means, categories of ownership, as well as the influence of local theology on quality.

Thesis statement
The following points, which will be discussed in more detail in this paper, help to define the responsibility for- and ownership of the quality of a given translation by the most relevant expression of the local church: 1) The Global Church contributes, both directly and indirectly. 2) It is not acceptable for Global Church individuals or entities to prescribe what is an acceptable understanding and translation of key Biblical terms, names, and concepts without a respectful dialogue with the Local. 3) The Local takes responsibility for the processes undertaken in producing a reliable translation of the Scriptures. 4) Publishers and funders rely on the integrity of the Local for a translation process which leads to a quality publication. 5) It is reasonable for the Local to rely on local or regional theology when deciding the most helpful linguistic representations for key Biblical concepts, names, and terms. 6) While organizations connected with a BT program accept responsibility for due diligence in achieving quality in translation, their ownership and responsibility for the quality of a translation are limited by the Local.

The paper will speak to current “claims” being made on the quality of translation in various places by members of the Western/Global Church. It will explore the rationale for attributing quality to what will be defined as the Local.
