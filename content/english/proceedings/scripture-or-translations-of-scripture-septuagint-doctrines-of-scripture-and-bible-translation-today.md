The Septuagint (LXX) and its use during the Apostolic Period have received much scholarly notice, but the implications of such use for today’s Bible translation efforts have received only scant attention. The high status of the LXX during that period conflicts with the belief that only “original manuscripts” can be divinely inspired and authoritative. Recent decades have witnessed vigorous debates about various doctrines of Scripture. These contributions have helped clarify the concepts of inerrancy and original manuscripts as well as the nature of divine and human involvement in the inscripturation and proclamation of the Scriptures. A functional view of the Scriptures’ ability to achieve God’s intended purposes shapes how both the LXX and today’s vernacular translations are viewed. This in turn contributes toward a new paradigm for translation quality and the processes and standards on which the translation, publication, and use of Scriptures are based.
