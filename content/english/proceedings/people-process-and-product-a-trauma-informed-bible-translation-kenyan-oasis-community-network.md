<p> A trauma-informed Bible translation considers the emotional impact of Scripture on readers who have experienced deep suffering. Instead of retelling the message of the text, it presents it in a way that acknowledges pain, offers hope, and avoids unnecessary re-traumatization. This document explores how trauma-informed translation can help render difficult passages in a more user-friendly way for a traumatized audience.  <br>  <br> The study adopts a qualitative approach with elements of ethnography and case study. Data was collected through literature review, comparative textual analysis, interviews and translator experience analysis.   <br> 1.        Potentially traumatic passages should be accompanied by clear introductions or footnotes that explain their meaning within the larger biblical story of love, justice, and redemption.  <br> 2.        Some descriptions of violence could be translated with less graphic language while still conveying the severity of the event. For instance, in Judges 19 (The Levite’s Concubine), gentler phrasing can be used for the woman's suffering, while a footnote acknowledges the cultural context of injustice in that period.   <br> 3.        Notes or paraphrases could emphasize where God provides comfort, justice, or restoration in difficult stories. For example, in the plagues of Egypt, a trauma-informed translation might clarify how God's actions were not arbitrary cruelty but a response to oppression.  <br> 4.        Some phrases could be adjusted to invite reflection rather than provoke fear. For example, Revelation could focus more on the hope of restoration rather than just destruction.   <br>  <br> In conclusion, a trauma-informed approach to Bible translation does not seek to change the core message of Scripture but rather presents it in a way that fosters healing, understanding, and hope. </p>
