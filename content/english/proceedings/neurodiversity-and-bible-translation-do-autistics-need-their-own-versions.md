<p>There has been an explosion of awareness of autism and other forms of neurodiversity, but autism is a broad spectrum rather than a single homogenous unit.  <br>  <br> Drawing on personal insights and research into both Autism and Scripture Engagement the author explores theologies of difference, disability and inclusion in different parts of the world. The study includes a brief history of specialist Bibles, before exploring how specialist Bibles, additional resources, and wider conversation might more greatly support the use and impact of the Bible. Furthermore the author explores how tools and discussion could catalyse the church in including neurodiverse individuals more effectively. <br> </p>
