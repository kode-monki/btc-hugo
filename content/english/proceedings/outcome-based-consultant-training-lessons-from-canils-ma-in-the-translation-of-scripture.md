Quality in translation requires quality translators and translation consultants – those who have mastered and demonstrated competency in various areas related to Bible translation.  As a result, there has been a push to train Bible translation consultants to  standards based upon an agreed set of competencies.  This approach has been embraced by SIL as well as the Northwest Seminary and the Canada Institute of Linguistics (CanIL).

This presentation will discuss how CanIL and Northwest Seminary negotiated the following questions as they set up their M.A. in the Translation of Scripture (MATS) in four different countries:

1.       How does one design a competency-based M.A. program?
2.       How does one translate competencies to measurable indicators?
3.       Who evaluates the competencies and indicators?
4.       How does one adapt a competency-based program to another language or context?
5.       What are the benefits of accreditation, and what is the accrediting agency looking for in the degree?
6.       What lessons have been learned so far?
7.       What issues need further research?

The presentation is based on a case study research methodology (the MATS program being the case study) with data being collected through: (a) interviews with mentors, students and administrators; (b) analysis of key documents used in designing the program; and (c) interaction with the literature related to competency-based theological education.
