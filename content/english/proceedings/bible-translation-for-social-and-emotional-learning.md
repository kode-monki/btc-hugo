Deaf children mostly are born into families where no one knows a sign language.  Often no one but the Deaf child learns a sign language and that does not happen until the child begins school.  Non-Deaf children acquire language from their families and neighbours.  They learn theory of mind, social norms and about the emotions they and others are experiencing.  Deaf children learn from what they are able to observe but with no explanation.  So Deaf children begin school far behind their non-Deaf peers in such skills.

BILAT, our Deaf partner organisation in Tanzania, had translated 15 Bible passages as Bible translation for children - WoW (Words of Wisdom).  Working with them as their translation and scripture engagement consultants we devised a programme using Deaf adult mentors to share these passages.  These mentors wrote songs for each passage, learned storytelling techniques and devised dramas.  Then they worked in pairs in Deaf schools.

It soon became apparent that certain of the stories, e.g., the unforgiving servant, were very effective in helping the children improve their social skills and understand and respond appropriately to their own and other's emotions.  Two important factors were stories with a range of emotions and the dramas when the children took turns playing each character.

Now SIL consultants are working with BILAT to choose the next set of passages. looking specifically for those which have a range of emotions expressed.  These will include a series of stories about Joseph (song of Jacob), Esther and Peter in the New Testament.
