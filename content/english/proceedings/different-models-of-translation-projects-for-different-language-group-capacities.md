<p>The number of Bible translation organizations working in Southeast Asia is growing, and each organization has their own approaches and methods. Some approaches are adequate for high-capacity language groups, namely language groups with a number of well-educated people, having available English speakers or speakers of a national language with extensive translation helps, and a core of people who are biblically trained. The people in such language groups can do many of the steps needed for quality translation themselves. But other approaches are more appropriate for lower-capacity language groups, namely those with low education, few or no available speakers of a language with sufficient translation helps, and a weak or nonexistent church. Such groups need more assistance to ensure good quality translation. When an approach that may be adequate for a high-capacity group is used with a language group with low capacity, the results can be problematic. This paper will describe three levels of translation organization assistance, along with three levels of language group capacity, and suggest how to match the organizational and language group levels for good quality assurance. It includes a metric for identifying the assistance level of translation organizations/strategies, and a metric for identifying the capacity level of language groups. Matching the appropriate assistance level with the appropriate language capacity level shows respect for the language group’s situation and improves translation quality.</p>
