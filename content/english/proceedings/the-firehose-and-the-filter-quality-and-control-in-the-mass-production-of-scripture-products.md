In exploring possible products and strategies using the gospel of Luke it was quickly apparent that there are hundreds of things that could be done with even a single book of scripture. In just a couple of weeks 100+ prototype resources could be made available in 1000+ languages. Some would be instantly usable straight away, some would need polishing and refining and some would be of little interest to the intended audience and might feel a complete waste of several minutes of work. 

There is a danger in releasing products that have not been adequately tested and perfected, There is also a danger in holding back until everything is considered perfect by an overcautious gatekeeper.

Luke himself includes the story of such a gatekeeper:

John said to Jesus, “Master, we saw someone using your name to cast out demons, but we told him to stop because he isn’t in our group.”

But Jesus said, “Don’t stop him! Anyone who is not against you is for you.”
Luke 9:49-50 (NLT)

In writing his gospel Luke carefully investigated his content with a view to writing an orderly account for his intended audience but includes the parable of the sower liberally scattering seed in places where it would not grow. This paper will explore how to develop strategies rather than just products, and discuss the issues involved in both sowing widely and filtering wisely.
