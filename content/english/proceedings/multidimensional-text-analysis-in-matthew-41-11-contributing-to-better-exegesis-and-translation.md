This paper proposes an interactive and integrated multidimensional approach to Biblical exegesis and translation as an important strategy to do justice to the multidimensional nature of meaning and to assure better and more comprehensive quality in translations. A dozen or so complementary approaches are discussed and illustrated from Matthew 4:1-11.
These include the following: Genre analysis, Style and Register analysis, Textual variation, Discourse analysis, Narrative analysis, Speech act analysis, Semantic analysis, Intertextual analysis, Emotional expression analysis, Pragmatic analysis, Rhetorical analysis, Performance, and Theological analysis.
