Singing is a big part of the Tsemay culture. Recently, through the Singing the Psalms initiative, the Tsemay people are singing the Psalms, which are a collection of poems of praise, prayers and teachings. In this initiative, in addition to translating the content of the Psalms, the poetic features of the psalms that significantly convey the meaning of the psalms are translated into Tsemay.
The purpose of this paper is to share the experience of the translators and exegetical advisors involved in this initiative. By doing so, we hope to encourage others to join this effort. In addition, it highlights the various essential elements required for quality translation in this project.
