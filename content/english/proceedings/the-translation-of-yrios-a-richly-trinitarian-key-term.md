<p>The Greek term κύριος (kurios) “Lord, master” is the most richly Trinitarian term for God used in the New Testament. Used as a title for the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, as well as to render the divine name (YHWH) when referring to all three members of the Trinity in different passages, κύριος plays a key role in tying the identity of Jesus to YHWH, the one true God of Israel. This is seen in many places throughout the New Testament, but especially in passages such as 1 Peter 1:24-2:8, 1 Peter 3:12-15, and 2 Corinthians 3:7-18. <br>  <br> This presentation outlines the Trinitarian role of κύριος, and explores ways of translating this term that allow its Trinitarian meaning to be available to readers. Special focus will be given to the following questions: <br>  <br>     • What is the semantic range of κύριος in the New Testament? <br>     • What are the implications, if any, of the presence or absence of the definite article in determining the referent or translation of κύριος? <br>     • How can the Trinitarian theology of κύριος be maintained in translation, and what are the theological and ethical considerations involved? <br>     • What does the New Testament’s use of κύριος as both a divine title and as a representation of YHWH imply for the translation of κύριος? What kind of term can fulfill both these functions in different languages?</p>
