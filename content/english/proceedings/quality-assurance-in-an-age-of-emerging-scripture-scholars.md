How can senior experts in Scripture translation multiply the impact of their skills by investing in emerging translation scholars?

With the global movement of church-led Bible translation projects expanding, there is a growing demand for experts in quality assurance. This paper presents a case study of an 18-month pilot project in which one Bible translation consultant mentored twelve language teams and was joined by three other consultants for periodic checking. Together, they were able to verify that “confidence could be placed in the quality of the translations.” Those mentored were able to serve in later projects at higher levels of expertise, further multiplying this impact.

This presentation gives evidence supporting the conclusion that confidence can be placed in translation models which prioritize urgency of access to Scripture, local ownership, and on-the-job training of local practitioners.

Finally, the paper explores how the global pool of Bible translation experts can work alongside emerging practitioners and church network leaders to multiply their impact and see the global task completed within our lifetimes.
