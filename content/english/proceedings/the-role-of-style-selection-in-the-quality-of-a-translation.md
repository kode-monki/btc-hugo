It is commonly perceived that the matter of Style is totally different from the matter of Quality in translation. But choice of style also can be a deciding factor which can contribute to the quality of a translation. 
Multilingualism is a reality in many parts of the world, especially in many Asian countries like India. Vast majority of remaining languages that probably would need a translation, fall into a category, where language attitudes are not very great. In a large number of minority languages of India, poor language attitudes are common even when language use is high in the traditional domains. In such a context, there will be many factors that can contribute to the translation not being received. From the author’s experience of being involved in a meaning-based translation in such an Indian language, it is clear that the main factor of the relatively good scripture engagement is linked to the choice of its style- i.e., an idiomatic meaning-based translation. Most people who have given positive feedback have one thing in common. They are unable to understand the meaning of many verses in the state language Bible. But when they read the Bible in their mother tongue, the meaning becomes very clear to them. Much importance was given to clarity and naturalness in the translation, and it is paying off now. If the mother tongue Bible was done in a literal style with a lot of state language loans, under pressure from various quarters, the Bible would have surely turned into disuse.
This paper attempts to exemplify the need for making a choice of style in favor of a clear meaning-based translation in languages with low language attitudes.
