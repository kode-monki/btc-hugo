<p>Many new translations, particularly Oral Bible Translations, are being carried out in languages where churches are emerging. It is widely recognized that there is implicit information within Biblical passages necessary for comprehensive understanding. The decision of whether to provide this implicit information remains a subject of debate. There are concerns about potentially underestimating the cognitive abilities of speakers of minority languages by supplying all the requisite information, versus the capability of these individuals to adequately comprehend Biblical passages without supplementary details. An even more contentious issue is determining the appropriate method for conveying this information, including questions about the sufficiency and extent of the information provided. This challenge is further amplified in the context of Oral Bible Translation. This paper examines these issues through a project conducted among language communities in South Asia, presenting insights and observations based on the feedback from readers and listeners of Biblical passages.</p>
