<p>Bible translation is a complex system where languages, cultures and theologies interact. Imagining Bible translation as a complex system where ethics, economics, and theology interact means repainting with a different color palette. Concepts from economists like Adam Smith, Keynes, Marx, and game theorists provide a frame for viewing aspects of Bible translation. Economics, ethics, and theology inform our decisions and our practices. Summary statements from fields of economics, ethics, and theology are painted with a broad brush over Bible translation practices. Works by Daniel Kahneman offer guidance in our decision practices by heightening understanding of thought processes and by potentially reducing bias and &quot;noise&quot; in decision processes.<br> </p>
