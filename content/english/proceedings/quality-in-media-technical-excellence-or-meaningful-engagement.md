In a media saturated world, we often expect effective media engagement to depend on quality digital Bible media products in local languages. We tend to assess their impact quantitatively, for example by counting the number of downloads or participants in listening groups. As a result, we make it our mission to reach even larger audiences using clever algorithms and sophisticated technology. However, social learning theory as well as research in media behavior show that the reach of media tells us little about their impact. Conversations on media platforms about media content, on the other hand, influence and transform people, even if only few participate. This is because the first thing that impacts people are people. In other words, increasing the reach of Bible media products in appropriate languages is not sufficient. I argue that such products must be complemented with content creation processes that a) have conversation as a starting point, b) lead to content that is by nature conversational, and c) lead to continued conversation as today’s topics inspire tomorrow’s content. Methods such as participatory radio drama or film development, social media conversations, or conversation-based formats such as debates or documentaries help to ensure that media conversations about the Scriptures are firmly rooted in the culture and expression of a community. What then, is the role of polished Bible media products and quality checked to near perfection, in the context of conversational, participatory media approaches? Must we choose between the quality of production versus the quality of conversation towards transformed lives?
