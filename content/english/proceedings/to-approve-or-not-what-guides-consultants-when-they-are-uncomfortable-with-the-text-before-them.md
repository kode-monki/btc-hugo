<p>The ethical responsibility of a Bible translation consultant is to ensure fidelity to the original text while considering cultural and theological sensitivities. However, consultants often encounter situations where they feel uneasy about approving a translation, even when the translation team is confident in its rendering. What principles should guide consultants in such cases? This paper explores the ethics of exegesis and interpretation in consultant decision-making, focusing on the tension between faithfulness to Scripture, contextual acceptability, and the avoidance of theological imposition. <br>  <br> Drawing from personal experience and case studies from interviews with other consultants, this study highlights best-practice translation principles and common challenges faced in translating sensitive cultural issues, unknown ideas, figures of speech, and the addition of implicit information. Examples include the translation of "wine" in South Asia, where cultural taboos influence interpretations of Jesus' actions, the use of indigenous terminology in Cambodia for biblical objects in historical contexts such as "oak tree," and the debate over translating "fear of the Lord"—whether as reverence or genuine fear—depending on theological traditions. These instances, and many others, underscore the fine line between necessary adaptation and theological imposition. <br>  <br> Ultimately, this paper argues that consultants must balance humility in exegesis with their role as quality assurance agents, recognizing multiple valid interpretations where justified, while guarding against unwarranted personal bias. It advocates for an ethical framework that helps consultants navigate discomfort without compromising the integrity of the biblical message. <br> </p>
