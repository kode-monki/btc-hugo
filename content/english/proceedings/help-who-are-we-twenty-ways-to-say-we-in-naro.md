<p>This paper highlights a most interesting feature, namely a great diversity of translation options for the first person plural. It emphasizes the need for both careful analysis of languages before translating, the need for thorough exegesis, and in-depth considerations in gauging translation options. <br>  <br> The Naro language (Khwe / Khoesan) boasts 18 options for translating a first person plural (or non-singular), distinguishing masculine, feminine, common, dual, plural, inclusive and exclusive. Together with majestic plural and author’s plural, Naro translators are in fact faced with 20 options of rendering the 1.PL.  <br>  <br> This paper will present the system of “PGN-markers” in Naro [PGN = Person, Gender, Number] with its different options, share challenges (translation-theoretical, exegetical, hermeneutical, cultural and discourse) and opportunities (esp. clarity, accuracy) in translation issues, and the practicalities of choosing between the different options. The PGN-markers occur in all (pro)nominal phrases and are comparable to both pronouns and articles. <br>  <br> Examples: <br> Acts 4:12 we must be saved: we = 1. Peter and John, or 2. the two + the council, or 3. all humans? <br> 1 Jn. 1:7 we walk in the light: we = 1. John, 2. John + coworkers; John + addressees? <br> Col. 1:3 we thank God: we = 1. Paul, 2. Paul + coworkers, 3. Paul + addressees? <br> Phlm 1:1 our fellow worker: our = 1. Paul; 2. Paul + Timothy; 3. Paul + male coworkers; 4. Paul + other workers (m/f)? <br> </p>
