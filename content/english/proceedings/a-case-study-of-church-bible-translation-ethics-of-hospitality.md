<p>While the church has played a role in Bible translation (BT) throughout history, there has been a type of Copernican Revolution recently that alters the relationship of the church with BT agencies and BT activities. However, many questions remain in this Revolution. What are the differences and commonalities between the various expressions of Church Bible Translation (CBT)? What precisely has changed with CBT? What are the subsequent roles of BT agencies in this Revolution? From a hermeneutics of hospitality, how do we understand actors of BT (guests, strangers, invaders, inviters/invitees, receivers, initiators, decision-makers, hostages, frontmen, custodians, etc.)? This study looks at the current trend of CBT and explores these relationships through the lens of hospitality. What are the ethical considerations and how might a careful, transparent, and authentic approach to BT be negotiated in this complex and multi-actor world of BT in the mid-21st century? Missiological issues are examined with a case study of BT in Papua New Guinea in general and the Evangelical Lutheran Church (ELC) of PNG in particular where the ELC has recently begun an intentional embodiment of CBT.</p>
