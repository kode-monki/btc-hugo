<p>Is there a place for character formation in translator training? <br>  <br> The Apostle Peter encourages us to make every effort to add to our faith virtue (2 Peter 1:5). From Aristotle and Plato to recent research it has been claimed that living a virtuous life is linked with individual and societal flourishing. However, in today’s educational philosophy, previously upheld guiding values have become fluid and shaped by the individual’s and the market’s focus on ‘success’ and ‘efficiency’. Educational efforts - intentionally or unintentionally - shape the character of the students through the curriculum, teaching staff and organisational culture. <br>  <br> In the field of Bible translator training, facilitating character formation is of importance not just because the translators’ life example can have an impact on the use of the translated Scriptures but also because it is a biblical value. In addition, navigating the complex challenges and decision-making processes in a translation project requires the cultivation of practical wisdom among other virtues. <br>  <br> This paper advocates for the place of intentional character formation in translator training, taking an approach that relies on insights from virtue ethics and theological education. A recently developed, practical, educational tool by Dr. Marvin Oxenham is also presented that could be used for facilitating the character formation of adult learners in various settings, including Bible translator training.</p>
