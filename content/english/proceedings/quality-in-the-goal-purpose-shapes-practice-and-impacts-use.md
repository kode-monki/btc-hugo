How do you hope the translated Scriptures will be used? 
Evangelism. Discipleship. Church growth and maturity.  

The concept of quality includes being fit for purpose. A Bible that is being used and applied is as foundational to translation as having a text that is accurate and natural. The choices you take, for example, about what to translate next, how and when to publish, which style and language to use are all underpinned by a desire for the translated Scriptures to be used, as much as they are by any technical expertise. 

This paper will explore how our motivation behind translation, the why, guides the who, what, where, when and how. Using the sociolinguistic and sociocultural factors developed by Dr. Wayne Dye as a framework, the author will outline how the purpose and priorities we adopt towards a translation direct where we focus our attention and any decisions we make. A translation fit for purpose is one that not only meets the linguistic needs of a community but also it’s social, emotional and cognitive needs too!
