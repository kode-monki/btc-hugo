<p>This paper examines the ethical considerations in the translation practices of the Bible Society of Nigeria (BSN), a member of over 200 national Bible Societies that make up the United Bible Societies Association (UBSA) and a major player in the Nigerian Bible Translation Industry. The paper examines the nexus of linguistic fidelity, cultural sensitivity, and theological accuracy in BSN’s translation efforts. This study also examines the translation ethics employed by the BSN, the ethical dilemmas encountered in relating with language communities and managing translation teams, the translation principles employed, strategies for handling the plethora of challenges encountered in  translation projects, and the implications of BSN’s translation ethics on the interpretation and application of Scriptures in the Nigerian Church. The study employs a qualitative research approach which blends desk research, interviews, and case studies with BSN translators, project managers, reviewers, and indigenous church and community leaders serving as research subjects. It is expected that the outcome of this research will contribute to the development of a contextualized translation ethics framework for the BSN so that accuracy, clarity, and naturalness of its Bible translations are guaranteed and God’s Word is communicated effectively to the target communities.
