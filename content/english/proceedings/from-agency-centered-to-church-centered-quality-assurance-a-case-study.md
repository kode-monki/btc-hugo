This is a case study of a church and a people embracing change. A community in Nigeria produced their New Testament under the agency-centered and consultant-led quality assurance model. As they begin translating the Old Testament, this community is choosing to transition to a more church-centered quality assurance approach. The church leaders are not rejecting the role of the consultant, who still serves with them, rather they are embracing their own role as owners of the privilege and the product of translation, and leaders of the process. They are significantly expanding the quality assurance team, volunteering their time, and offering space in their churches, in an effort to accelerate access to quality Scripture. This shift is bearing fruit: improved quality in drafts, development of the translation brief, joyful Scripture engagement, and more. The church leaders themselves tell the story of this transition and the impact it is having in their community and church life.
