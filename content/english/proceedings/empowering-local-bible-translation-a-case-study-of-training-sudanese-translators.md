<p>Church Centric Bible Translation (CCBT) relies on competent, ethical exegesis of scripture during the translation process in order to produce an accurate, trusted, trustworthy text, which raises the question on whether the CCBT approach will work in an area without an established Christian tradition. unfoldingWord and partner organizations were able to overcome this challenge by integrating theological formation with training in Bible translation principles and practices. Training and technology have significantly reduced reliance on outside consultants, making it possible for the Sudanese to translate the Bible for themselves in areas closed to Westerners.  <br>  <br> Using the Equipping Journey curriculum, a combination of Bible translation, ministry training, and theological formation over three years, the foundation was laid for responsible interpretation and exegesis, ensuring that the resulting translations reflected sound theological understanding. Training translators on both the principles and practices of translation while training on the essentials of the Christian faith, the initiative cultivated a deep respect for the Word of God and the skills necessary for theological discernment.  <br>  <br> The result of this intensive three-year effort has resulted in a self-sustaining cadre of qualified Sudanese translators, trainers, and technical staff. The ability of the Sudanese network to take on the training responsibilities has demonstrated the effectiveness of this capacity-building approach. The project illustrates how incorporating theological formation alongside translation skills, it is possible to establish indigenous teams capable of producing accurate and trustworthy Bible translations. Moreover, they can sustain this work independently in areas inaccessible to Western consultants. This model offers valuable insights for addressing Bible poverty in regions where traditional methods are not viable while establishing a strong theological foundation for responsible and sustainable translation work.  <br> </p>
