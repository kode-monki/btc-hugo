<p>Is the use of AI-produced drafts in a Bible translation project something your team has been contemplating? Perhaps you&#x27;ve heard of promising results from peers who have adopted AI technologies. This session will offer help for assessing the value of AI drafting (machine translation) in your particular context, and best practices for implementing this technology in a Bible translation project. You will receive a concise list of ethical and practical questions that a language project must grapple with to assess readiness and plan for thoughtful and successful adoption of AI drafting technology. We highlight potential pitfalls of over-reliance on technology and introduce the idea of a “translator as craftsman” approach to AI tools. <br> <br> Topics covered include the following: <br> cultivating an environment of ethical AI adoption among all language project stakeholders, including funders; supporting translators, advisors, and consultants by recognizing and closing the training gap AI technologies introduce; and designing an integrated workflow so that AI drafting contributes maximally to the larger translation workflow while minimizing disruption. <br> <br> Join us to get further insights into how AI technologies can contribute most to a language program, and why some teams might consider saying “no” to AI adoption.</p>
