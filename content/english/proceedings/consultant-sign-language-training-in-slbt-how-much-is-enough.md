<p>On a daily basis Deaf people experience the frustration of having to interact with people who are unable to effectively communicate with them because they don't know sign language. In Sign Language Bible Translation (SLBT) there is a need for translation consultants who are able to work and communicate effectively with Deaf translation teams. <br>  <br> Hearing translation consultants can have various levels of sign language ability, from no ability to sign to a high level of fluency. On the one hand, reaching a high level of fluency in sign language can be a daunting task, taking considerable time and resources. On the other hand, not communicating effectively risks disempowering and alienating the very people for whom the Bible is being translated.  <br>  <br> By interviewing Deaf consultants, Deaf translators and hearing consultants who have worked in SLBT, this paper explores what level of sign language fluency is necessary for a translation consultant to ethically and effectively work with a Deaf translation team.</p>
