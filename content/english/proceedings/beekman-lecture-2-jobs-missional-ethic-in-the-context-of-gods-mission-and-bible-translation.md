<p>This presentation examines Job 31 as a missional ethical creed that integrates integrity before God with justice, compassion, humility, and accountability. Drawing on missional hermeneutic frameworks, it argues that ethics is central, not peripheral, to God’s mission, and therefore indispensable for all engaged in Bible translation. Participants in the <em>missio Dei</em> are called to discern and embody ethical practices of integrity, transparency, cultural respect, and humility. Read missionally, Job 31 reveals that the credibility of God’s message depends on the integrity of God’s messengers. In short, there is no mission without missional ethics.</p>
