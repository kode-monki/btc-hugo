<p>This paper examines the complex challenges and emerging opportunities in training mother-tongue translators from minority language communities, many of whom rely on mediating languages rather than direct access to original biblical texts. Given the scarcity of biblical and linguistic resources in low-resource languages, AI-generated drafts are increasingly being introduced as a support tool in the translation process. However, this shift presents both potential benefits and ethical dilemmas. The paper explores the extent to which AI can enhance translation efficiency, linguistic accuracy, and exegetical depth while ensuring that the theological integrity of the text is preserved. It also investigates the challenges translators face when adapting to AI-assisted workflows, including issues of trust, post-editing competencies, and the risk of diminishing their exegetical engagement with the biblical message. Additionally, this paper examines research methodologies for comparing AI-assisted and traditional translation approaches, assessing their impact on both the quality of translation and the professional development of translators. By identifying key training needs and potential gaps in translator engagement, this presentation aims to offer practical strategies for integrating AI in a way that strengthens, rather than undermines, the role of human translators in Bible translation for low-resource communities.</p>
