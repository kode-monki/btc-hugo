<p>This paper presents scholarship regarding the nature and origins of the Masoretic accents of the Hebrew Bible, both in their vocalized and written forms (Wickes 1881, 1887; Dotan 1970, 1981; Revell 1971, 1979, 2004; Yeivin 1980; Aronoff 1985, Dresher 1994; Eldar 1990, 1992, 1994, 2018; Khan 2013, 2020; Popović 2017; Jacobson 2017; Kleiner 2019; Gentry and Meade 2020; Habib 2021; Khazdan 2021; De Hoop and Sanders 2022). With respect to this scholarship, six common misconceptions are identified: 1) the “melody” of the accents is musical; 2) the disjunctive accents are punctuation marks that encode relative grades of pause; 3) the accents represent the Masoretes’ understanding of the syntax of the biblical text; 4) the disjunctive accents mark poetic lines; 5) the accents were devised to facilitate group reading; and 6) the accentual system is less reliable than the vowel pointings and therefore does not deserve the care and attention that we give to the vocalic notation. In contrast to these misconceptions, the recognition of the accentual system as a prosodic orthography selects prosodic phonology as the appropriate discipline with which to analyze the accents (see Pitcher 2023, 2025, forthcoming). Accordingly, the paper discusses prosodic phonology as a dimension of the grammar of a language that interfaces with syntax, semantics, and discourse-pragmatics, and provides a preview of what we can expect the accents to contribute to an oral rendering of the biblical text.</p>
