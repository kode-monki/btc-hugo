This presentation presents a case study of perceived translation quality as it relates to the existing network of translation practices in Oji-Cree culture. Inspired by Hymes’ (1964, 1974) approach to the “ethnography of communication,” we present ethnographic observations about Oji-Cree translation practices in the domains of public interpreting, public oral translation of scripture text in real time, collaborative editing of texts, and language teaching. Key themes include the existence of a mimetic tradition (de Vries 2001), symbolic functions of indigenous language use, and the processes of gradual consensus building used by translators. Finally, we share ways that these cultural practices affect the translation of the Oji-Cree Bible and community perceptions of its overall quality.
