Keeping track of consultants, their training, and their work is a difficult task for any entity.  SIL Asia has developed a Smartsheets system to keep track of this information.  
Smartsheets is easy, which allows non-technical personnel to use the system.  Smartsheets is flexible, which allows each entity to customize what they want to get out of the data.  Smartsheets is automated, which means no one needs to spend a lot of time in the Smartsheets system.
In this paper we will look at what the Asia Area Smartsheets system was designed to do; namely:
-	track CiT training and development
-	track CiT’s competencies in alignment with CBC
-	track CiT’s work once they are full consultants
-	track all consultant’s work based on their FTE
This paper will also briefly look at some benefits this Smartsheets system does, which were not the original design; namely:
-	archive consultant reports
-	track project’s progress
-	collect project’s checking requests
-	assign a consultant for checking requests
This paper will primarily describe the Smartsheets system we have designed.  However, it will briefly look at the data gathered in 2022 and propose some reasons for the consultant shortage across SIL Asia.
