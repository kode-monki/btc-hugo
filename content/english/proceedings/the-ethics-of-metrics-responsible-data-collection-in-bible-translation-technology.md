<p>In the digital age, metrics are easier to collect than ever before. However, the collection of data in Bible translation tools raises ethical questions: When is it acceptable to gather metrics, and how should they be used? This paper explores the ethical implications of software metrics in Bible translation, balancing the need for insights with concerns about privacy, consent, and misuse. <br>  <br> Biblical teachings on counting provide valuable context for this discussion. Scripture warns against using numbers to promote pride or idolatry, such as in the case of David’s census in 2 Samuel 24, where counting led to consequences driven by selfish motives. Yet, there are also examples where counting and measuring align with God’s intentional order (e.g., the census in Exodus). These teachings remind us that the purpose and motivation behind collecting metrics are as important as the data itself. <br>  <br> The paper will also examine the impacts of collecting metrics on both users and developers. For users, knowing that their data is being tracked can have both motivating and discouraging effects. It can incentivize engagement, but also lead to a sense of surveillance or intrusion, which may lead to a breakdown of trust. For developers, metrics can be encouraging and help prioritize improvements, but they may also encourage a focus on flashy, attention-grabbing features at the expense of less visible, but equally important, functional improvements. <br>  <br> Drawing from biblical principles and ethical frameworks, this paper will propose guidelines for responsible data collection in Bible translation technology. The aim is to ensure that data collection respects privacy and user autonomy while enabling developers to enhance software in ways that serve both immediate and long-term needs for Bible translation work.</p>
