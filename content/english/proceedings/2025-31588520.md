<p>Intentional inconsistencies in Bible translation are both unethical and indefensible, particularly when they result in theological confusion and misinterpretation. Such inconsistencies can distort essential Christian doctrines, with even greater consequences for lay readers. The failure of translators to correct the unethical practices of their predecessors only worsens the problem, compromising the integrity of the translation. <br>  <br> This study examines unethical translation practices, focusing on the selection of words and names that undermine theological accuracy and consistency. Through case studies, it highlights the impact of these practices and advocates for ethically sound translation methods in future Bible translations. <br>  <br> •  Case Study 1: The translation of Christologically significant words <br> •  Case Study 2: Translation vs. transliteration vs. renaming of the divine name YeHoVaHa <br> •  Case Study 3: Translation vs. transliteration vs. renaming of people's names, particularly those that begin with the "Ya" sound <br>  <br> This research emphasizes the necessity of integrity in Bible translation to ensure doctrinal clarity and faithfulness to the original text. <br> </p>
