<p>The interpretation and translation of the Hebrew word הבל (hebel) in Ecclesiastes remains a heated debate in Biblical Studies. Traditional approaches often render the term as "vanity," "meaninglessness," or "futility," yet these translations may obscure its original material sense. This paper advocates for an approach that preserves the physical imagery of "breath," aligning with the term’s linguistic and contextual nuances. <br>  <br> However, maintaining this material sense does not eliminate all interpretative and translational challenges. Engaging with Hikaru Kumon’s dissertation, How Qoheleth Thought: A Natural Semantic Metalanguage Analysis of Ecclesiastes, this paper addresses some of the difficulties of translating this metaphor across cultural and linguistic boundaries. Different languages conceptualize abstract ideas differently, raising the question of whether metaphors grounded in physical imagery—such as "breath"—can retain their intended connotations in varying linguistic and cultural contexts. <br>  <br> By examining both ancient and modern perspectives on הבל, this paper aims to demonstrate how preserving the material sense of the term enhances interpretive clarity while also necessitating thoughtful cross-cultural translation strategies.</p>
