Have you ever had the niggling thought, Am I missing things I should be catching?  What is the back translation not telling me?  How do you discover what you don’t know and can’t see and sometimes can barely hear? 
 
Have you ever struggled with doing comprehension checking by Zoom or stopped trying? Have you ever been stymied by unexpected problems that have caught you off guard during a check?  How do you handle those especially when working remotely?

This presentation will provide insights on how to sharpen our consulting skill to deal with these challenges. By analyzing the results of previous consultant checks, we can discern potential blind spots and develop practices to address those. 

We will look at some creative ways when working remotely to check people’s understanding of a text, and spend some time allowing for ideas from the floor as well.
