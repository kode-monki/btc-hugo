<p>Greek and other European languages commonly use relative clauses for back-grounding information. <br>  <br> Because Doctor Luke was a person trained in Greek literature, and used Greek in its normal meaning and functions, all illustrations will come from his book of Acts. <br> Kandozhi has a construction that grammatically appears to be very similar to European relative clauses, but has a totally different function. <br>  <br> So, what is going on at the semantic level? There seems to be three categories of meaning of relative clauses: 1) identification, 2) description, and 3) restriction.</p>
