<p>In Genesis 1 and 2, four key Hebrew verbs—kāḇaš (כָּבַשׁ), rāḏāh (רָדָה), ʿāḇaḏ (עָבַד), and šāmar (שָׁמַר)—are pivotal in shaping humanity's relationship with the rest of creation. In Genesis 1:28, God commands humans to "subdue" (kāḇaš) the earth and "have dominion" (rāḏāh) over all living creatures. In Genesis 2:15, humans are placed in the Garden of Eden to "work" (ʿāḇaḏ) and "keep" (šāmar) it. These verbs have been translated in various ways, profoundly influencing how people perceive humanity's responsibilities within creation. <br>  <br> This presentation builds on four articles I have written on these verbs in the Key Terms of the Old Testament series. It will explore the ethical frameworks that have shaped the historical exegesis and translation of these terms, encouraging translators to critically examine their own ethical perspectives. By doing so, it aims to inform and guide their approach to rendering these pivotal verbs in the creation narratives.</p>
