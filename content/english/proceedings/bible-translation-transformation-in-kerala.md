Kerala, the southernmost state of India witnessed the greatest impact by Bible translators in making it the most developed modern region in the country. Their influence on the State language, Malayalam, is seen in its various aspects including orthography, morphology, lexicon, phrases, idioms, literature and education. Several Biblical terms from Hebrew, Greek, or Aramaic, have found their way into the Malayalam lexicon, as cognates, or adapted according to the phonology of Malayalam, thus enriching the vocabulary of the language. Several people from overseas influenced Kerala including the Portuguese, Dutch, French, and the English. The Bible translators among them triggered immense socio-economic and cultural transformation of the society, liberating people from slavery, caste discrimination, superstitious rituals, offering human dignity and identity. 
As pioneers, the Bible translators established printing presses, produced the first grammar book, multilingual dictionary, literature of various genres, educational books, newspapers and magazines. Schools, colleges, and adult literacy facilities made this State the most literate. They also introduced several agricultural services and food products.
By caring for the poor, the marginalized, downtrodden, handicapped, blind, deaf, dumb and leprosy victims, and by empowering women and children, the Bible translators initiated a social revolution. Thus, they became the makers, movers, and builders of modern Kerala.
