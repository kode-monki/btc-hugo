Psalms were composed to be orally performed. Consequently the translator needs to be cognizant of the paralinguistic features of spoken (or chanted/sung) language, as well as the extra-linguistic elements of performance. Paralinguistic features include those related to the delivery (pace, intonation, volume, the use of pauses) and those involving body movement (gestures, facial expressions, and direction of the speech – to indicate the addressee). Extra-linguistic elements include props, costume, as well as the place and time of the performance. All of these contribute to the message communicated, and consequently need to be carefully considered. 

In this paper, first a brief review is given of some of the differences between oral and written communication. These are important as the way language is structured and delivered for aural reception must be tailored for the ear. In particular, oral text must include mnemonic devices which will facilitate recall, as well as presentation techniques which promote clear understanding. Examples of both of these are given (from recent workshops with Africans in three different countries).

Second, some empirically-tested examples are given of ways performance can be used throughout the translation process. These include obtaining a “big picture” perspective of the backstory to the psalm and/or some details within the psalm itself. Performance is also very helpful in developing a good rhythm and sound patterns, as well as in delivering the message in a way that is easily and enjoyably received by the audience. 

It is hoped that this paper will encourage all translators to explore using performance in their translation process.
