<p>My recent wife Sheila and I worked with SIL in the Kandozhi language as translation advisors for the NT and 40%  of the OT. This was done during a span of about sixty years. The Kandozhi people live in a very remote part of the Amazon jungle of Peru. We published articles about the language and culture listed in the SIL bibliography.</p>
