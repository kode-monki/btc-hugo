<p>I combine my work as head of translation at the Bible Society for the Netherlands and Flanders with the (endowed) chair of Bible Translation at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. I contributed to the Dutch <em>Bible in Plain Language</em>and the revision of the Dutch <em>Nieuwe Bijbelvertaling</em>. My research interest lies in contextualizing Bible translation, as a historical phenomenon and a contemporary activity.</p>
