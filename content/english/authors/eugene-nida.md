Consistent with the vision and mission of the Nida Institute, the Nida Lecture creates space in the conference program for the presentation of scholarship from Translation Studies and related fields.

<strong>Eugene A. Nida</strong> was a linguist who developed the dynamic-equivalence Bible-translation theory and one of the founders of the modern discipline of translation studies.
