<p>Hephzibah’s research intersects translation, religion, history, and postcolonial studies. She has a keen interest in the way ideas, texts or objects considered sacred are translated across language cultures and history. She retains a strong research interest in South Asian literary and translation cultures.</p>
<br>
<p>At the University of Edinburgh, she teaches translation theory and methods at the postgraduate level with a focus on literary and sacred text translation. Before joining Edinburgh, she taught Literary Studies at the Open University&#x27;s London Region and at the University of Delhi at St. Stephen College (1996-1997) and Lady Shri Ram College (1997-2009) in India. She has trained PhD students at the Translation Research Summer School and NIDA School of Translation Studies over several summers and taught on Erasmus Exchange programmes in Europe and India.</p>
<br>
<p>She holds postgraduate degrees in English Literature from the University of Delhi and specialized in translation studies as a Felix doctoral scholar at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London. Her doctoral research focused on the Tamil Bible as a text that was born out of debates on translation, language use, literature and religions in colonial south India.</p>
<br>
<p>She authored <em>Religious Transactions in Colonial South India: Language, Translation and the Making of Protestant Identity </em>(2011), a monograph analyzing the translated Tamil Bible as an object of cultural transfer in South Asia in the context of evolving attitudes to translation in the Tamil sacred landscapes from the eighteenth century onwards. More recently, she has edited the <em>Routledge Handbook of Translation and Religion </em>(2023). She has guest edited (with Matthias Frenz) a special issue on ‘Religion and Translation’ (2019) for the journal <em>Religion </em>and a special issue entitled ‘Translation in India: Multilingual practices and cultural histories of texts’ (<em>Translation Studies</em> 2021). She is chair of the editorial board of the book series, <em>Approaches to Translation Studies</em> (Brill) and co-edits the book series, <em>Creative, Social and Transnational Perspectives on Translation</em> (Routledge). Her multilingual poetry on translation and border-crossings was exhibited at the Talbot Rice Gallery, Edinburgh, June-September 2023.</p>
