<p>I love to explore human creativity and diversity through the lens of anthropology and translation in Papua New Guinea and the Pacific generally. My focus is on Christianity, Melanesian studies, personhood, relationality, unity ("wanbel" in Tok Pisin), sectarianism, missions, and translation. I have a PhD from the University of Adelaide (2019).</p>
