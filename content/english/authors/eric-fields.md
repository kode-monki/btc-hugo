<p>I am an SIL translator with the *Makori translation project in Niger, W. Africa. I live in the Dallas area, working remotely. I am a global thinker, and I enjoy looking at language and cognition. My interest in Discourse Analysis lies at the intersection of Biblical Studies, Biblical Languages, and Linguistics.</p>
